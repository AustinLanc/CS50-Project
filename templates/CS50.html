                <p>Our first week in CS50 involved making a project in Scratch, a drag and drop programming platform made by MIT. \
                    The purpose of this week was to begin the introduction of variables, loops, and other simple programming basics. \
                    For my project, I decided to make a simple game that involved the player controlling a butterfly being chased by a bat. \
                    The longer the user avoided the bat, the higher of score they received.  Below is a screen shot of my simple game.</p> \
                <img src="/static/0/scratch-1.PNG" alt="example gameplay"> \
                <p>While this game is very simple, it defines custom variables, while loops, and if statements, some of the fundamentals of \
                    programming languages.  Below is a screen shot of the code for the butterfly. </p> \
                <img src="/static/0/scratch-2.PNG" alt="code for the butterfly"> \
                <p>As you can see, two functions are defined: move and reset.  The move function takes an input of speed and uses the value \
                    to translate the butterfly sprite in a direction.  This function uses if statements to determine which direction to \
                    translate the sprite and also to check if the butterfly sprite is touching the bat sprite.  This simple game also has \
                    other functions and conditionals to account for other things such as the score. </p>',
        "1": '<h2>Week 1 - C</h2> \
                <p>This week covered the basics of programming with C.  Before this, I had very little experience with \
                    actual programming languages.  We switched over to using a GitHub Codespace and VSCode setup specifically for \
                    the course.  We began writing a program that many others have done before: "Hello, world!"  From this, we learned \
                    some of the syntax of C, including header files and the <code>main</code> function itself.  At this point, most of us \
                    just copied the structure without understanding it, but it gave us familiarity with it nonetheless.  Below \
                    is the entire code for this program.</p> \
                <img src="/static/1/hello_world.PNG" alt="code for hello, world in C"> \
                <p>We quickly built off this so it would instead greet the user.  To do this, the program would first ask \
                    for a name using the <code>get_string</code> function created by the CS50 team.  It would then print "Hello, [name]" \
                    where [name] is the user input.  You can see from the image below that this code is also pretty simple, \
                    especially since we had the <code>get_string</code> function.  In later weeks, we learned more about how C handles \
                    strings.</p> \
                <img src="/static/1/hello_name.PNG" alt="code for hello, name in C"> \
                <p>Once these starter programs were complete, we were tasked with writing code that would take a \
                    user input and draw a pyramid of #s, reminiscent of the first Super Mario Brothers game.  Looking \
                    at the code below, it is more complicated, but is still relatively simple compared to future weeks.</p> \
                <img src="/static/1/mario.PNG" alt="code written in C to draw a pyramid of #s for a given user input"> \
                <p>And here is an example output for an input of 5.</p> \
                <img src="/static/1/mario-output.PNG" alt="output for an input of 5"> \
                <p>As you can see, this code uses more conditionals and even incorporates an additional function.  \
                    To start, a do-while loop is used to make sure the user has a valid input (an integer >= 1).  \
                    it is important to note that the <code>get_int</code> function already checks to make sure the input \
                    is an integer and not any other type.  Once a valid input has been estabilshed, the <code>main</code> function then \
                    calls the <code>block</code> function using the <code>height</code> variable as an argument.  The <code>block</code> \
                    function uses for loops to write #s to the command-line, resulting in a pyramid being drawn.</p> \
                <p>The last project for this week was to write code that would validate a user inputted credit card number and determine \
                    what company the card was from if the number was valid.  To begin, Luhn\'s Algorithm was used to check if the entered \
                    number was syntactically valid.  If the number passed this check, the length and prefix was then compared to \
                    the standards for valid credit card numbers for Visa, Mastercard, and American Express.  If the number matched one \
                    of these companies, the program would output the type of card it was.  If the number failed the Luhn\'s Algorithm check \
                    or the prefix and length did not match any of the three companies, the program would return "INVALID" instead.  Here \
                    is the code for the <code>main</code> function.</p> \
                <img src="/static/1/credit-1.PNG" alt="main function for the week 1 credit project"> \
                <p>As you can see, the program asks for a user input and then declares a temporary variable.  This variable is then divided \
                    by 10 until it is less than 100, meaning it is only two digits long.  Every time the variable is divided, another variable \
                    called <code>digits</code> is incremented to store the total digits of the user input.  The program then uses Luhn\'s Algorithm \
                    to check if the user input is a syntactically valid credit card number using the <code>valid</code> function shown below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/1/credit-2.PNG" alt="the valid function of the program"> \
                <p>While this may not be the most efficient way to incorporate Luhn\'s Algorithm, it functions the same.  The function returns <code>true</code> \
                    if the number is syntactically valid and <code>false</code> if not.  If it returns <code>true</code>, the program then calls the <code>type</code> \
                    function shown below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/1/credit-3.PNG" alt="the type function of the program"> \
                <p>This function uses if statements to attempt to match the length of the user input and the prefix to one of the three companies.  If it finds a match, \
                    it returns the type of card it is, and if not, it will return "INVALID" instead.  The values used in these if statements are based on what requirements \
                    the companies actually use when assigning card numbers.  While this project was intended to be used as a learning tool, similar programs can be used \
                    by malicious people to generate fake, but "valid" card numbers.</p> \
                <p>By the end of this week, I felt more confident using C to make small programs and was excited to learn more.</p>',
        "2": '<h2>Week 2 - Arrays</h2> \
                <p>In this week, we took a look at variables, scope, arrays, and command line arguments.  We first learned that the <code>make</code> command we had been using \
                    actually used clang to compile our code to assembly code and eventually to an executable program.  We also learned that compiling is just one of four steps.  \
                    There is also preprocessing, assembling, and linking.</p> \
                <p>When defining variables, we looked at how different data types are stored.  For example, strings are stored as an array of characters, meaning each char is \
                    stored back to back in memory.  Also, the special character <code>\\0</code>, a byte of all 0 bits, comes at the end of arrays to denote the end.  We also \
                    covered what cryptography and encryption are.  With our newfound knowledge, we were tasked with writing a program that would take two user string inputs and \
                    based on the scrabble scoring system, determine which word and therefore player scored more.  Below is the code I wrote to complete this task.</p> \
                <img src="/static/2/scrabble.PNG" alt="code for scrabble problem"> \
                <p>As you can see, once the program starts, it prompts the user for two inputs using <code>get_string</code> and stores them as <code>word1</code> and \
                    <code>word2</code>.  The <code>main</code> function then calls the <code>get_score</code> function I defined for both user inputs.  This function \
                    iterates over each character in the word and determines the position in the <code>letter_scores</code> array it should use and then adding it to \
                    the total score.  The scores are stored as <code>score1</code> and <code>score2</code> and are compared to determine which player wins.  This is \
                    by no means the most efficient method to complete this problem, but I believe it is straightforward and sufficient for the amount of material we had \
                    covered by this point.</p> \
                <p>Our next problem to solve was to determine the reading level of the text a user entered based on the Coleman-Liau index.  Like the previous problem, \
                    the user input was stored as a string called <code>text</code> which was then passed into the <code>get_level</code> function I defined as can be seen below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/2/readability-1.PNG" alt="main and get level functions for the readability problem"> \
                <p>The function iterates over each character in the string and determines if the character is a letter, punctuation, or space.  Based on the result, it \
                    increments the count for the <code>characters</code>, <code>sentences</code>, and <code>words</code> variables respectively.  Once all of these were \
                    determined for the entire text, the reading level was calculated as shown below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/2/readability-2.PNG" alt="code to determine the reading level"> \
                <p>The final problem for this week covered cryptography.  We were tasked with writing a program that would use a cipher key \
                    and then convert a user input from plaintext to ciphertext using substitution.  Unlike all of our previous problems, we now had to incorporate command-line arguments.  To \
                    start, we changed the <code>main</code> function to now have arguments instead of just <code>void</code>.  These new arguments were an integer called \
                    <code>argc</code> and a "string" called <code>argv</code>.</p> \
                <img src="/static/2/substitution-1.PNG" alt="modified main function to account for command-line arguments"> \
                <p>The <code>argc</code> argument was used to determine the number of command-line arguments to make sure there were only two: the name of the program which by default \
                    is always included, and the cipher the user inputs.  If any additional command-line arguments are entered, the program will alert the user to the correct usage \
                    and not proceed further.  If the usage is correct, the program will check <code>argv[1]</code>, the cipher key, to make sure all 26 letters are only used once and will then ask the user \
                    for their plaintext.  This then gets used along with the cipher key to generate a <code>ciphertext</code> string using the function below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/2/substitution-2.PNG" alt="plaintext to ciphertext function"> \
                <p>Note that the <code>else</code> part of this is not part of the for loop and is only called if the key is invalid, meaning it is less that 26 characters long or has duplicate letters.</p>',
        "3": '<h2>Week 3 - Algorithms</h2> \
                <p>For week 3, we covered a couple algorithms and learned how different methods of solving the same problem can result in drastically different runtime.  To \
                    get an idea of just how much an algorithm can impact the time, we looked at different algorithms including linear search, binary search, selection sort, bubble sort, and merge \
                    sort.  We broke these down and looked at the different Big O Notations for them and saw that by adjusting how we search an array, we could go from O(n^2) to O(nlogn).  With \
                    this new knowledge and perspective on solving tasks, we were asked to begin by analyzing three sorting programs and match them to the algorithm they used.</p> \
                <p>Our options to choose from were selection sort, bubble sort, and merge sort.  Figuring out which program used merge sort was easy since this algorithm is much \
                    more efficient than the other two and therefore had a significantly lower runtime.  To differentiate between the other two, I ran them both against a list of sorted \
                    numbers from 1 to 50000.  Since the numbers are already sorted, bubble algorithm would not have to move any terms around while selection sort would still have to \
                    iterate over the list many times.  While there is no code to show for this problem, I think it was a good example for us to see some of the algorithms we had learned \
                    about in action</p> \
                <p>The next problem tasked us with extending the functionality of some provided code, namely creating the <code>vote</code> and the <code>print_winner</code> functions \
                    to create a program that runs a plurality election.  This program takes up to nine different candidates for command-line arguments and then asks for the number of \
                    voters.  The <code>main</code> function then requests user input that number of times and calls the <code>vote</code> function.  This can be seen with the code below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/3/plurality-1.PNG" alt="main function requesting user inputs and calling the vote function"> \
                <p>Note that this is only a portion of a code from the <code>main</code> function.  This is because as the problems become more complex, there is too many lines of code \
                    to reasonably show since the goal is to show off all the different projects we covered in the course.</p> \
                <img src="/static/3/plurality-2.PNG" alt="the vote function"> \
                <p>Above shows my implementation of the <code>vote</code> function.  All it does is use <code>strcmp</code> to check if the <code>name</code> argument matches any of the \
                    candidates.  If it finds a match, it will increment their <code>votes</code> property by one and return <code>true</code>.  This function has a boolean return since \
                    the <code>main</code> function expects a boolean result back to determine if the vote was valid or not.  Once all the votes are tallied, the <code>main</code> function \
                    calls the <code>print_winner</code> function shown below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/3/plurality-3.PNG" alt="the print winner function"> \
                <p>With this problem solved, we moved onto a similar, but much more challenging problem: make a program that uses a tideman voting system.  Like the previous problem, some \
                    of the code was provided to us by the CS50 staff, so we were tasked to extended the functionality of the program, namely writing the <code>vote</code>, <code>record_preferences</code>, \
                    <code>add_pairs</code>, <code>sort_pairs</code>, <code>lock_pairs</code>, and the <code>print_winner</code> functions.  The <code>main</code> function was provided and below is a snippet.</p> \
                <img src="/static/3/tideman-1.PNG" alt="snippet of the main function for the tideman code"> \
                <p>This part calls the <code>vote</code> function to check if the vote is valid.  This function can be seen below, and at first glance, it can be confusing, especially without the entire source code.</p> \
                <img src="/static/3/tideman-2.PNG" alt="the vote function of the tideman code"> \
                <p>To break this down, the function takes in three parameters: <code>rank</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>ranks[]</code>.  The first parameter is the voters desired rank for a given candidate \
                    while the second is the name of the candidate.  The last is an array containing the voters desired ranks that gets updated.  Using a for loop and <code>strcmp</code>, \
                    the function attempts to find a match between the <code>name</code> parameter and the names of the previously entered candidates.  If there is a match, the <code>ranks</code> array \
                    gets updated such that the value at the <code>rank</code> index is set to the candidate\'s index in the <code>candidates</code> array.</p> \
                <p>That may be confusing, so here is an example.  Say there are three candidates: Alice, Bob, and Charlie, and they are stored in that order in the <code>candidates</code> array.  If \
                    a voter\'s preference was to vote Bob, Charlie, and Alice from first choice to last, their <code>ranks</code> array would be updated to [1, 2, 0] (remember that arrays start \
                    with an index of 0).  Similarly, if their preference was instead Charlie, Alice, Bob, their <code>ranks</code> array would be [2, 0, 1].</p> \
                <p>After the <code>vote</code> function is called, the <code>main</code> function calls the <code>record_preferences</code> function using the updated <code>ranks</code> array for the \
                    voter.  This function can be seen below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/3/tideman-3.PNG" alt="the record preferences function of the tideman code"> \
                <p>Again, this function can be confusing at a first glance.  The function uses a double-nested for loop to iterate over the <code>ranks</code> array and updates the <code>preferences</code> matrix \
                    to increment the value at the position by one.  A positive value instead of zero, the starting value for all positions, means that the candidate in the ith row is preferred over the candidate in \
                    the jth column by that number of voters.  For example, if the <code>ranks</code> array was [2, 0, 1] for the first voter, the <code>preferences</code> matrix would be [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0].  If \
                    a second voter had a <code>ranks</code> array of [1, 2, 0], the <code>preferences</code> matrix would be updated to [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0].</p> \
                <p>Once all of the preferences were stored, the <code>add_pairs</code> function was called.  This function iterates over the <code>preferences</code> matrix and compares the number of voters who prefer \
                    candidate i over candidate j versus the number of voters who prefer candidate j over candidate i.  By doing so, pairs of winners and losers are determined and stored.  Below is the code for the function.</p> \
                <img src="/static/3/tideman-4.PNG" alt="the add pairs function for the tideman code"> \
                <p>The function checks to see if there is a tie first, and if there is not, it will store the index of the candidate who is preferred as the winner and the index of the other candidate as the \
                    loser.  A secondary variable <code>pair_count</code> is incremented when a winner and a loser is determined.  This variable is used in the next function <code>sort_pairs</code> shown below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/3/tideman-5.PNG" alt="the sort pairs function for the tideman code"> \
                <p>While this was one of the hardest problems in the entire course, I think after completing it, I had a better understanding of how to code and different types of data structures.  If anyone has taken or is planning \
                    to take CS50, I highly recommend choosing to do this problem, even if you struggle throughout it.</p>',
        "4": '<h2>Week 4 - Memory</h2> \
                <p>Week 4 focused on memory\'s role when coding, specifically how variables are stored and how C interacts with them.  In order to better understand memory and memory addresses, we first covered hexadecimal values \
                    and their purpose.  Unlike decimal or binary notation, hexadecimal is based on base-16, meaning 0-9 and A-F values are used for each position (representing the values 0-15 in decimal).  A very common real world \
                    example of hexadecimal\'s use is with RGB which uses values from 0-255 in decimal.  Each color is represented as a two digit hexadecimal value from 00 to FF and join together to create a six digit hexadecimal \
                    representation of a color.</p> \
                <p>Up until this point, we had been using <code>get_string</code> and the data type <code>string</code> to handle strings of characters, but we didn\'t have a good understanding of what C does behind the \
                    curtains.  Conventionally, memory addresses use hexadecimal notation.  When data is stored, such as when assigning a variable, it is store at an address which can be referenced when needed.  Strings \
                    are not an exception to this, but are handled a little differently than some may expect.  Since strings are made up of multiple characters, or chars, when they are stored in memory, each char is stored \
                    in memory in a sequence, meaning their memory addresses directly follow the previous one.</p> \
                    <p>With C, the first memory address is what actually gets assigned to the variable, not the string itself.  This is \
                    why if you set two different strings <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> and attempt to check their equivalency by doing <code>s == t</code>, it will return false.  What C actually is doing is comparing the \
                    memory addresses of the first character of each string.  Luckily, people have created workarounds for this such as <code>strcmp</code> which can be implemented by including various header files.</p> \
                <p>To work with memory addresses, C has two built in options: <code>*</code> and <code>&</code> which instruct the compiler to go to a location in memory and provides the address for something stored in memory \
                    respectively.  This is seen when rewriting the <code>string</code> datatype to what it actually is: <code>char *</code>.  Knowing how C handles strings is important, especially when attempting to complete \
                    a seemingly simple tasks such as copying a string.  While it would make sense to do <code>string t = s</code> to copy string <code>s</code> to a new string <code>t</code>, this actually just causes the \
                    memory address for <code>s</code> to get copied instead.  To fix this, we learned about two more C functions: <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>.</p> \
                <p>The <code>malloc</code> function is used to allocate a specified amount of memory.  This is useful because it helps to prevent segmentation faults.  By allocating the needed amount of memory to copy \
                    a string, you can ensure all of the characters, including the \\0 special character can be correctly stored.  The actually copying can be done in multiple ways, such as using a for loop, but there \
                    is also the <code>strcpy</code> function which does the same thing, allowing for cleaner and shorter code.  Once the allocated memory is no longer needed, it is important to use the <code>free</code> function \
                    to ensure their are no memory leaks.  Tools like Valgrind are especially helpful for checking memory issues.</p> \
                <p>Our first problem for this week was to scale the volume of an audio file by a user defined amount.  This means that each 2-byte integer representing each sample in the WAV file.  Since the CS50 team had \
                    already wrote the code to handle the file opening and closing, we just had to write the part that would copy the 44-byte header and increase the volume of the audio.  To complete the first task, the code below \
                    was used.  Note that <code>HEADER_SIZE</code>, <code>input</code>, and <code>output</code> were defined earlier in the code and set to 44, the user defined input file, and the user defined output file respectively.</p> \
                <img src="/static/4/volume-1.PNG" alt="code to copy the WAV header from the input file to the output file"> \
                <p>All that was left to do was write the code to increase the volume by multiplying the samples by the user defined factor as shown below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/4/volume-2.PNG" alt="code to increase the sample volumes"> \
                <p>Note that <code>factor</code> was also defined earlier in the code and was user defined using the last command-line argument.  The data type <code>int16_t</code> was used since each sample is represented as a \
                    16-bit integer for this problem, although WAV files can use different numbers of bits.</p> \
                <p>The second problem we looked at involved creating a gray scale, blur, mirrored, and edge filter.  This is achieved by copying the RGB values for each pixel in an input image, modifying the values of each color \
                    channel, and then storing them in an output file.  A lot of the code for this problem was provided by the CS50 team, so we only had to focus on writing the code that would iterate over each pixel in an image \
                    and modify the RGB values depending on the user specified filter type.</p> \
                <p>The first filter to work on was the gray scale one.  This was probably the simplest one since the effect is achieved by averaging the color channel values together and then setting each one equal to that value.  Below \
                    is the code I wrote to do this.</p> \
                <img src="/static/4/filter-1.PNG" alt="gray scale filter code"> \
                <p>Note that the type <code>RGBTRIPLE</code> originally comes from Microsoft and was adapted by the CS50 team.  This allows other parts of the code to select and edit each color channel individually.  Below is the data structure.</p> \
                <img src="/static/4/filter-2.PNG" alt="RGBTRIPLE data structure"> \
                <p>The second filter was the mirror filter.  All this filter does is flip the image along the vertical axis, meaning things on the left would instead appear on the right.  This was also a relatively short function to write as seen below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/4/filter-3.PNG" alt="mirror filter code"> \
                <p>While the first two filters only required using the RGB values of one pixel at a time or simply swapped the positions of two, the third filter, a box-blur filter, required calculating the average RGB values of all neighboring pixels.  The \
                    for loop setup was similar since we still needed to iterate over all of the pixels, but a second set of for loops were used inside of those to iterate over the pixel\'s neighbors.  Pixels on the edge or corners of the image required \
                    special attention since they had less neighbors, meaning the average values had to be calculated differently.  This consideration can be seen in the code using an if statement that catches if the current pixel would be outside of \
                    the image bounds.  Note that since the RGB values of the neighboring pixels are used, the pixels are stored as a temporary image and are copied over to the original at the end.  The entire function can be seen below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/4/filter-4.PNG" alt="code for blur filter"> \
                <p>The last and most difficult filter to implement was the edge filter.  This used the Sobel operator to determine a weighted sum of RGB values of all the neighboring pixels.  Some of the ideas from the previous filter were reused, \
                    but in order to correctly use the Sobel operator, two matrices, Gx and Gy, were used.  When applied, the values for the color channels for the pixel could be determined by square-rooting the sum of the Gx^2 and Gy^2.  To start, the \
                    following variables were defined.</p> \
                <img src="/static/4/filter-5.PNG" alt="edge filter variable definitions"> \
                <p>Once again, a temporary image is used to store the calculated values until the end.  With these variables and a lot of for loops, the below code was made.</p> \
                <img src="/static/4/filter-6.PNG" alt="edge filter loops"> \
                <p>As you can see, this filter required the most code by far, and I hesitated to even include it all.  Since the RGB color channel values are limited between 0 and 255, the code includes a section at the end to limit the calculated values \
                    if needed.  While I typically try to avoid nested for loops since they can drastically increase runtime, I could not think of a better way to implement these filters.</p> \
                <p>The last problem for this week was to create a program that would attempt to recover images by reading through a "forensic image" of a memory card.  This file was provided by the CS50 staff and we were asked to recover JPEG files.  Since \
                    the first three bytes of these files are consistent, an occurrence of them typically denotes the beginning of an image\'s data.  Using this knowledge and the fact that the memory card was assumed to be a zeroed out, FAT formatted \
                    device, the following code was written.</p> \
                <img src="/static/4/recover.PNG" alt="code for the recovery problem"> \
                <p>As you can probably tell, a good chuck of the code is not show.  The remaining code handles checking the command-line arguments, opening the raw file, and initializing variables.  There is also parts that use <code>malloc</code> and \
                    <code>free</code> to handling allocating and freeing the memory associated with <code>filename</code>.  I chose to leave these parts out since there was a lot of code already shown for previous problems, but I hope this is sufficient \
                    for your understanding of how this problem was completed.</p>',
        "5": '<h2>Week 5 - Data Structures</h2> \
                <p>Week 5 focused on different types of data structures such as linked lists, hash tables, queues, and stacks.  Linked lists use pointers to point to other locations in memory instead of contiguous memory chunks.  They use nodes that \
                    hold data and a pointer to another node.  Singly-linked lists and doubly-linked list are nearly the same except doubly-linked list nodes contain pointers to both the previous and next node.  In C, you can define a data struct of a \
                    node and use <code>malloc(sizeof(node))</code> to properly allocate enough memory when creating new nodes.  Linked lists can be formed using different approaches to either generate prepending or appending lists.</p> \
                <p>Hash tables are a mix between arrays and linked lists.  Their main benefit is that they are technically O(n), although various factors such as your hashing algorithm can cause slower runtime in real world settings.  Essentially \
                    hash tables are arrays of linked lists and work best when they are perfectly balanced.  Tries on the other hand are basically the opposite and are "trees" of arrays.  Both data structures have their uses and can make task \
                    much more efficient if used properly.</p> \
                <p>The last topic I\'ll discuss from this week is queues and stacks.  Queues operate on a first in, first out basis.  Enqueue and dequeue are terms used to describe the action of adding a removing from a queue respectively.  A \
                    common real world example would be standing in line for a roller coaster.  Stacks instead operate on a last in, first out basis and use the terms push an pop when adding and removing items.  This would be more similar to \
                    parking cars in a single car wide driveway.  The first car would have to wait until all cars behind it are moved before it could leave.</p> \
                <p>Our first task for this week was to add functionality to a program that would create a family of a specified generation size and assign blood type alleles to each person.  To keep each member of the family together, linked \
                    lists were used where each person had two parents and their alleles were taken from both parents.  Each parent would essentially donate one of theirs at random.</p> \
                <p>Since multiple functions and data structures were already defined for us, our first task was to write the <code>create_family</code> function which is shown below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/5/inheritance-1.PNG" alt="code for create family function"> \
                <p>The function starts off by allocating memory using <code>malloc</code> and then checks to see if <code>generations</code> is greater than one, meaning parents need to be created.  If so, two people are made: <code>parent0</code> and \
                    <code>parent1</code>.  This is done recursively in order to generate enough people to fill the desired amount of generations.  The parents are then assigned to the child\'s <code>parent</code> array and the alleles for the child are \
                    randomly assigned based on the alleles of their parents.  Once the final generation is reached, the parents are set to <code>NULL</code> and the alleles are randomly assigned using <code>random_allele()</code>.</p> \
                <p>Since <code>malloc</code> was used, the memory has to be freed back up at the end of the program.  This was taken care of by the <code>free_family</code> function we were also tasked with writing.  This also recursively goes through \
                    each branch of the family tree and works back down all the way to the original person.  The function can be seen below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/5/inheritance-2.PNG" alt="code for free family function"> \
                <p>The second problem for this week was to create a spell checker by storing a word list in a hash table and then iterating over every word in a text.  We were tasked with writing the <code>load</code>, <code>hash</code>, <code>size</code>, \
                    <code>check</code>, and <code>unload</code> functions.  The first function was used to open a file containing the list of accepted words and determine an index for them to begin creating an array of linked lists, or a hash table.  The code \
                    for the <code>load</code> function is shown below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/5/speller-1.PNG" alt="code for load function"> \
                <p>The index is determined based on the first three letters of the word.  Conditionals are used to account for words shorter than three characters, but the basic pattern is the same.  Once an index is determined, a new node is created containing \
                    the word and the rest of the linked list at that index.  This process repeats until the entire dictionary has been loaded.</p> \
                <p>The next function <code>hash</code> is very similar to the <code>load</code> function but instead only determines what index a provided word should have.  A word like "storm" would have an index of 13378.  When I had initially reviewed my code \
                    to write this part up and to find the index for the word "storm" I realized I had made a mistake in my code.  While I thought I was correctly calculating indices for two or more character words, I forgot to account for arrays having a zero \
                    index.  While this issue was relatively small, It still caused some words to be out of order.  I have since fixed, recompiled, and tested my code.  The images for the <code>load</code> and <code>hash</code> function are the updated versions.  The \
                    hash function is shown below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/5/speller-2.PNG" alt="code for hash function"> \
                <p>The third function <code>size</code> was used to count the number of words in the loaded dictionary.  Since most of the work for doing so was handled by the <code>load</code> function, all the <code>size</code> function had to do was return a variable.  The \
                    code is shown below even though it is only three lines.</p> \
                <img src="/static/5/speller-3.PNG" alt="code for size function"> \
                <p>The actual spell checking came with the <code>check</code> function.  First, an index is determined using the <code>hash</code> function.  The linked list at that location is then navigated and the word is compared to the word stored in the node.  If a match \
                    is found, the function returns <code>true</code>, meaning the word has been verified to be in the loaded dictionary.  The code can been seen below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/5/speller-4.PNG" alt="code for check function"> \
                <p>Since we allocated memory, we also had to include and <code>unload</code> function to ensure there was no memory leaks.  This is simply done by iterating through each linked list and freeing each node for every index.  Since this program used the first three \
                    letters of a word, there are 18278 potential linked lists; however, this number is substantially reduced since not every combination of three letters is used at the beginning of words in English, let alone the limited amount in the loaded dictionary.  The \
                    <code>unload</code> function is shown below. </p> \

        "6": '<h2>Week 6 - Python</h2> \
                <p>Up until this week, we had been using C for everything.  While C is not a bad programming language, it is an older one and many newer programming languages have implemented quality of life features that C just doesn\'t have.  Python is one example which has \
                    become quite popular, especially due to its easy to follow syntax.  To help us switch gears, we were tasked with revisiting some of our previous problems and rewriting them in Python.  The first one was one of our first programs we wrote in C where the user \
                    would enter their name and the program would respond with a greeting.  With all of the quality of life features python has implemented, the code was shorter.  This can be seen below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/6/hello.PNG" alt="hello name code in python"> \
                <p>We also revisited the mario problem that would construct a pyramid of # signs.  This time, the code was significantly shorter while still completing the task just as well.  One of the main reasons for this was the ability to end the output of a <code>print</code> \
                    function in python with a specified ending instead of the default <code>\\n</code>.  The code is shown below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/6/mario.PNG" alt="mario code in python"> \
                <p>The third problem we revamped in Python was the credit card program that would validate credit card numbers.  By this point, it should be obvious that the new code would be shorter than the one written in C.  Granted, I probably had many inefficient methods to solve \
                    the problems, especially with them being some of the first ones.  With that being said, I still enjoy using Python over C if I have the option.  The code for the rewritten credit problem is displayed below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/6/credit.PNG" alt="credit code in python"> \
                <p>The final problem we went back to was the readability problem.  The new code follows the same ideas but uses arrays to store different punctuation instead of using as many <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> operators.  This allows for a cleaner code overall as seen below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/6/readability.PNG" alt="readability code in python"> \
                <p>We also completed a completely new problem involving matching short tandem repeats (STR) to an individuals DNA sequence to attempt to find a match.  The CS50 provided some of the code for us and tasked us with writing the <code>main</code> function which is responsible for \
                    checking the command-line usage, reading the database file and the DNA sequence file, finding the longest match of each STR, and checking for a match.  Below is the code to complete these tasks.</p> \
                <img src="/static/6/dna.PNG" alt="dna code"> \
                <p>Before this week, I already had some experience with Python, so this week served as a refresher and a learning experience.  While I understand why many courses choose to start by having students us C, Python\'s syntax significantly easier to a beginner student to understand, \
                    at least in my opinion.</p>',
        "7": '<h2>Week 7 - SQL</h2> \
                <p>Week 7 was a little different from the others.  Instead of writing code like we had been up until this point, we instead learned about SQL, specifically SQLite, and some of the available manipulations to tables that can be done.  We started with writing SQL queries to \
                    answer questions about Spotify\'s top 100 streamed songs of 2018.  These questions ranged from listing songs by an artist to computing the average energy value of a group of songs.  Since the database of songs was provided to us, we only had to focus on the query aspect \
                    of SQL.</p> \
                <p>This was similar for the next problem which involved an IMDB database, although the questions were more complex and involved nesting queries together.  For example, one of the questions asked for us to find all the movies where Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both \
                    starred.  Again, since the table was already provided to us, we just had to write different queries.</p> \
                <p>For the third problem, we essentially did the same thing, but we had to solve a mystery only using SQL queries and a provided database containing multiple tables.  This task actually provided somewhat of a challenge since we had to use some critical thinking on top of \
                    coming up with good queries that would provide clues.  I chained a lot of queries together to solve the mystery and it was quite messy at one point.  Luckily the mess was an easy fix by just using multiple lines and indentation.</p> \
                <p>Since this week didn\'t have any code to show and I believe showing all the SQL queries would be meaningless without having the databases and questions as context, no images are included.  However, this week did peak my interest and led to me starting my own small \
                    database for some data we have at my job.  Right now, it basically just serves as a backup incase the main Excel sheet somehow gets deleted, but this week gave me the knowledge needed to do it.</p>',
        "8": '<h2>Week 8 - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h2> \
                <p>This week we switched gears once again looked at some of the basics of how web pages are formed and how computers communicate with each other over the internet.  Since this week had a lot of different topics to cover, we were only able to spend a short amount of \
                    time on each.  We learned about TCP and how it allows computers to send and receive data using sequence numbers and specifying port numbers.  Along with this, we briefly looked at how IP addresses and DNS servers work, leading to a discussion about HTTP/HTTPS and \
                    the GET and POST request methods.</p> \
                <p>During this week, some basic HTML tags were covered such as those for paragraphs, headers, lists, and tables.  Along with our discussion of HTML, we scratched the surface of CSS and how it interacts with HTML tags, ids, and classes.  The last thing we learned was \
                    some simple JavaScript code that completed tasks related to web pages, more specifically adding event listeners to HTML elements and setting functions to run on intervals.</p> \
                <p>Since there was so much to cover during this week, the lecture only was able to scratch the surface of each topic, meaning that the problems for this week were fairly straight forward.  The first problem was to create a trivia page where a user can answer a couple \
                    of questions, one being a multiple choice and the other being a free response.  We were provided the skeleton of the page and were tasked with adding the headers, buttons, and the text input field.  Along with this, we were asked to make the buttons change color \
                    when clicked based on their correctness and to make text appear when the free form question was answered.  Below is a screenshot of the trivia page that I made that shows some of the features.</p> \

                <p>As you can see, it is a very simple page, but it was useful to complete before doing the second problem of the week: creating a homepage that contained multiple HTML pages, various CSS styles, and some JavaScript.  This problem allowed for creative freedom to design \
                    it however we wanted as long as it met certain specifications.  Since I was still relatively new to the topics, I made a page that contains and "About Me" section, a page that displayed a picture of a dog that would bark when it was clicked, and a page containing \
                    the music video to Rick Astley\'s "Never Gonna Give You Up" which was set to autoplay.  I\'ve included a screenshot of the front page so you can get a general idea of what it looked like, but if that doesn\'t satisfy you, I also included a zip file containing \

                <p>Week 9 introduced a new tool for us to use to improve the functionality of our web pages: Flask.  Flask is a micro-framework written in Python that allows for route and request handling.  It utilizes Jinja to create dynamic pages that can be updated in real-time \
                    without having to hard code each page.  This idea can be seen with Google searches, although Google uses a different framework.  Flask also provides the functionality of Python to web pages, similar to how JavaScript can be used with HTML pages.  Along with this, \
                    Flask makes the handling of GET and POST request methods simple, allowing for users with little experience to create small web applications.</p> \
                <p>Our first experience using Flask came with our first problem for the week: creating a page where users could add birthdays to a list that would be displayed and updated in real-time.  We were asked to create a form for the user to use that would update an SQL table \
                    when submitted if the user\'s request method was POST and to display the list of birthdays if the request was GET.  To separate the actions taken for each request, a simple if statement was used.</p> \
                <p>To add birthdays, the user would enter in the information and click submit.  If their entry was a valid birthday, the Python file for the Flask application would connect to the database file and <code>INSERT</code> the birthday as a new line for the SQL table.  The \
                    CS50 team provided a Python module that made it easier to interact with the database, so this step was not too difficult to implement.  If a user was to open the page or if it reloaded after a submission, the request method would be GET, and Flask would render the \
                    HTML template using a variable containing the complete list of birthdays.  A for loop written with Jinja would add HTML elements containing the data form the SQL table so everything was displayed properly.  This also meant the page was dynamically updated each time \
                    a user added a birthday.  Below is a screenshot of the page itself.</p> \
                <img src="/static/9/birthday-1.PNG" alt="birthday main page"> \
                <p>And here is the Flask code that handles most of everything.</p> \
                <img src="/static/9/birthday-2.PNG" alt="flask code for birthday page"> \
                <p>The second problem was more complicated and involved making a web page for a stock buying and selling simulation.  Users were required to make an account and log in to be able to trade stocks.  They would start with $10,000 and were able to check prices of various \
                    stocks and could trade stocks if so desired.  An additional piece of functionality was added where the user could add money to their account.</p> \
                <p>Some of the code for this problem was provided to us, but a large chunk of it still had to be written.  We began with making a page for a user to register on.  Once a username and password were chosen, the database of existing users would be check to verify \
                    a user with the same username didn\'t already exists.  If the username was unique, it would be stored in an SQL table along with a hashed password.  While the password could have been stored directly, it is best practice to always hash them for cyber safety \
                    purposes.  Below is the Python code dedicated to handling account creations.  If you hadn\'t noticed at this point, the SQL queries contain question marks.  This is done to mitigate inputs that could modify the query and make it do unexpected or even malicious \
                    things.</p> \
                <img src="/static/9/finance-1.PNG" alt="code for account creation"> \
                <p>Once successfully registered and logged in, the user would be greeted with a page like the one shown here.</p> \
                <img src="/static/9/finance-2.PNG" alt="finance homepage"> \
                <p>Our next task was to implement a page the user could use to look up stock prices.  The user would enter a company\'s symbol and the page would return the current price of the stock based on Yahoo Finance\'s data.  Below is a screenshot of the page and the \
                    Python code used to handle the requests.</p> \
                <img src="/static/9/finance-3.PNG" alt="quote page"> \
                <br> \
                <img src="/static/9/finance-4.PNG" alt="request handling code for quote page"> \
                <p>If a user then decided they would like to purchase the stock, they could move to the buy page and do so.  The page looks nearly identical to the quote page but also contains a field where the user can enter the number of stocks they wish to buy.  Since this \
                    was supposed simulate actually trading stocks, checks were put in place to make sure the user had enough money to complete the purchase and if so, their account would be deducted and updated.  This is all taken care of using Python as seen below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/9/finance-5.PNG" alt="request handling code for buy page"> \
                <p>Users were also able to sell stock they owned on the sell page.  This page looked identical to the nuy page but utilized a dropdown menu to select which stocks to sell.  Error handling was added to ensure the user actually had the amount of stocks they \
                    wanted to sell, and if the request was successful, their account would be credited.  The code for this page is longer and more involved, but it is provided below.</p> \
                <img src="/static/9/finance-6.PNG" alt="request handling code for sell page"> \
                <p>To summarize the above code, when the page is loaded, it first calculates what shares the user has by summing all of the transactions for the user.  If the user has sent a POST request, it validates that the user has enough shares.  If so, another \
                    transaction is added to the SQL table and the user is credited the current value of the sold shares.  There is error handling to account for any abnormal cases, such as the user attempts to sell shares they don\'t own by manipulating the HTML \
                    code.  If the request method is instead GET, the user\'s current stocks are calculated and the HTML code is dynamically changed to show only ones they can sell.</p> \
                <p>Since users may just want to view stocks they currently own or just see the total value of their account, we were tasked with created an index page that would be the default page after the user logs in.  This page is used to show the user\'s cash and \
                    current stock values.  To get information about their portfolio, every transaction the user had made would be looked at and the total shares for each stock they owned would be determined.  The current stock prices would be determined so the user would \
                    know how much funds they had on hand and how much they had invested.  An example index page is shown below along with the code that handles requests for the page.  Note that the example index page comes from the CS50 team\'s implementation but the \
                    one I made is nearly identical with the exception that I have added an "Add Cash" option.</p> \

                <img src="/static/9/finance-8.PNG" alt="request handling code for index page"> \
                <p>The last page to implement was one that would display all of the user\'s transactions with timestamps and values.  Since this data was already being recorded in the same SQL table the other pages used, this was one of the easier pages to create.  Only \
                    GET requests would be used, so there was no need to account for POST requests.  Below is the relatively short code.</p> \
                <img src="/static/9/finance-9.PNG" alt="request handling code for history page"> \
                <p>And here is an example showing both purchases and sells.</p> \

                <p>This was one of the most time consuming problems of the entire course, but a large part of that was because I couldn\'t decide how I wanted to store all the required information in an SQL table.  The rest of the time was mainly spent making sure enough \
                    error handling was implemented to make sure users couldn\'t do things like sell stocks they don\'t own or buy more than they could afford.  Although it was time consuming, this problem was necessary to do because without it, this website would be \
                    significantly worse.</p>',
