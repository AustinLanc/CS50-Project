# Portfolio for Austin Lancaster
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
I have created a web application to display information about myself and to show off some of the projects we completed in CS50.  When thinking of what to do for the final project, I wanted to make something that I could update and keep using in the future.  While I initially thought of making a mobile game for android devices, I decided that I would not be able to sufficiently create a complex and neat looking application.  This led me to my second idea: a web application.
Since there are so many possibilities for different types of web applications, I chose to go with a portfolio style.  Even though this could be done using static pages, I decided to go with a web application to add complexity.  When the website is opened, the index page is just a short introduction inviting users to browse the other pages.  There is also an option for the user to sign the page if they would like.  Their signature is first passed through a profanity filter to ensure they will not appear on the page later.  Once the signature passes the test, the form is submitted via POST.  In the app.py file, if route “/” is submitted this way, it will connect to a database called “signature.db” and insert a new row containing an id, the signature itself, and a time stamp obtained from using datetime.  The data in the table is then selected and used in the index.html template using Jinja.  The data is iterated over and put into a list; however, this is not a standard HTML list.  Instead, I opted to create a scrolling list using JavaScript to add some personality to it.  Once there are enough signatures, the list will begin to scroll infinitely.  To make this animation smoother, the list is cloned, but this part is only shown when scrolling.  This eliminates the jump to the top of the list that would otherwise occur.
The next page on the website is an about page which displays my picture, a short description of myself, and my resume.  When first loading, my resume is hidden and can be shown using a button that contains an eye symbol from Font Awesome.  Once this button is clicked, my resume is shown and the eyeball icon is changed using JavaScript.  While I initially thought of not having my resume hidden by default, I believe it looks cleaner this way, and some people are probably not interested in it anyway.
The third page is dedicated to CS50.  It contains a slides showing some of the projects we worked on during the course, beginning with “hello, world.”  There are pictures of some of the code with descriptions near them to help viewers better understand what they are looking at.  The second slide shows our Mario project written in both C and Python as well as an example input.  Since this code is still relatively short, the entire thing can be displayed without issue.  This is not true for the third slide showing code from the “credit” project.  The code is displayed in two images to combat its length.  While I would like to instead have all the projects be able to run directly in the webpage, I could not think of or find a good way to do so at this time.  The slides are navigated using the arrows below the images and are looping, meaning the user can click the next slide button forever without issue.  This is done using JavaScript.  The titles are stored in an array and are updated along with the display style of the slides.  All slides have their display set to “none” except the current slide which is instead set to “block.”
The final page is a contact form in case any viewer would like to ask questions or send a comment.  Initially, this form was going to be completely handled using Python modules to send an email directly to me, but this posed a security risk if the source code was ever leaked.  Since I am not confident enough in my cybersecurity abilities, I instead went with a third party service called Formspree.  Using their HTML form templates, I was able to successfully implement a contact forum that doesn’t require any sensitive information to be in the source code.  To check form submissions, I just have to log into Formspree with my account.
This project required that I learned more about SQL and Python interactions, HTML and CSS, and how to do more with JavaScript.  While I am far from having a mastery over these languages, I believe I have gained a decent amount of knowledge about them from working on this web application.
